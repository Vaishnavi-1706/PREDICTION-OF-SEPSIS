# PREDICTION-OF-SEPSIS
Sepsis is a severe, life-threatening medical condition that arises from the body's extreme response to an infection, leading to organ failure and high mortality rates if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical assessments that may cause delays, making early detection critical for improving patient outcomes. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), predictive models offer a promising solution for the early identification of sepsis, enabling timely medical intervention.
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered sepsis prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on patient vitals, laboratory parameters, and medical history to classify individuals at risk of sepsis. A web-based interface is designed to facilitate real-time data input and immediate risk assessment for healthcare professionals. The system employs a Random Forest classifier for prediction, with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) implemented to address class imbalance in medical datasets.
The model development process includes data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, ensuring robust and accurate predictions. Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on maximizing recall to reduce false negatives. The web-based interface, built using Streamlit, enhances usability, providing an accessible and interpretable tool for medical practitioners. Ethical considerations, including patient data privacy, model fairness, and transparency, are also addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment.
